This application is to show how LLM's can be used as a Q&A  interface for an existing repository of data definitions about HR/People metrics that are widely used in the organizations. In this tool, a user such as HRBP or any people team member can ask questions related to how various people metrics are defined which would be helpful before they see any descriptive/diagnostic or prescriptive analysis presented by a People Data team.
